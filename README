Yâˆ†V
===
yav is a Golang "live" static blog. Content is kept in memory for fast delivery
and checked against disk to grab updates to the site. It was aimed to be for
personal use but open for all.

Template functionality is provided by Go's html/template and sprig. Check out
the documentation of both packages:
  * https://golang.org/pkg/text/template/
  * http://masterminds.github.io/sprig/

By default it will try to use HTTPS so a certificate and key should be supplied.
Plain HTTP is also available by disabling HTTPS via "-use-https=false".

Use "-help" for all the program flags.

Build
=====

$ cd src/ && go build -o ../yav

File tree
=========
There are 2 directories that are really important for this program to work:
  * site/: all markdown files and extra files to be served.
  * template/: template files used to render the pages.

Without them yav will fail miserably. Example files exist on those directories
to see it working.

Front Matter
============
Taken from Jekyll. This way functionality can be extended and variables can be
passed to the template directly from the markdown files.

yav front matter variables:
  * `template` (string): *required* dictates which template to use.
  * `render` (bool): display the markdown content rendered to HTML or plain.

Template functions
==================
Some extra functions were added to yav besides the mentioned previously.
  * `dirls (string)`: directory listing. Returns: array of strings.
  * `toTplExt (string)`: converts from markdown to template extensions. Returns:
  string.

Requirements
============
