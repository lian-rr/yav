yav is a Golang "live" static blog. Content is kept in memory for fast delivery
and checked against disk to grab updates to the site.

Template functionality is provided by Go's html/template and sprig. Check out
the documentation of both packages:
  * https://golang.org/pkg/text/template/
  * http://masterminds.github.io/sprig/

By default it will try to use HTTPS so a certificate and key should be supplied.
Plain HTTP is also available by disabling HTTPS via "-use-https=false".

Use "-help" for all the program flags.

Build
=====

$ cd src/ && go build -o ../yav

File tree
=========
There are 2 directories that are really important for this program to work:
  * site/: all markdown files and extra files to be served.
  * template/: template files used to render the pages.

Without them yav will fail miserably. Example files exist on those directories
to see it working.

Front Matter
============
Taken from Jekyll. This way functionality can be extended and variables can be
passed to the template directly from the markdown files.

yav front matter variables:
  * `template` (string): *required* dictates which template to use.
  * `render` (bool): display the markdown content rendered to HTML or plain.

Requirements
============

Issues
======
A lot. Please open a ticket.
